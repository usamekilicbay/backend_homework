# Instructions #

Attached, please find a console application which main purpose is to convert the formats.

## Prepare: ##

1. Please find at least 5 potential code issues an be able to explain the reason behind it.

2. Refactor the app to allow:
	- Work with documents of various storages eg. filesystem, cloud storage or HTTP (HTML read-only) etc. Implement just one of them but be sure that implementation is versatile for adding other storages.
	- Be capable of reading/writing different formats. Implement XML and JSON format, but be sure that implementation is versatile for adding more formats (YAML, BSON, etc.). 
	- Build the app in the way to be able to test classes in isolation
	- Be able to add new formats and storages in the future so it will have none or minimal impact on the existing code
	- Be able to use any combination of input/output storages and formats (eg. read JSON from filesystem, convert to XML and upload to cloud storage)

## Things to remember ##
Weâ€™re going to appraise the **design of given code** that should match the quality of production application. Thus imagine this application as a system ready for feature development (adding new storages or formats).

**Tests should be written** as demonstration of your skills, there is no need to cover everything.

## Delivery ##
Please version progress as usual, upload your homework to GitHub or other preferred git storage and send us link. Alternatively, use git archive and send us a ZIP archive.
